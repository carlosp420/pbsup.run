/*****************************************************************************\
 This TNT script gets Partitioned Bremer Support (PBS) values from
 any number of partitions.

 1) Your matrix should be in a file called dataset.tnt
 2) PBS values will be taken for the nodes of your strict consensus tree which
    should be called base.tre
 3) All your most parsimonious trees should be in a file called alltrees.tre
 4) After getting the PBS values for each node, this script will write a temporary
    file called pbs.tmp that will have the PBS values found so far, just in case
    your computer crashes or someone turns it off, so you won't have to start all
    over again
 5) The output file is called pbs.out and it is actually a tree file in
    parentethical notation. It will have all the PBS values attached to the
    respective nodes.
